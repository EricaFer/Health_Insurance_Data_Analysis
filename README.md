# 🏥 Health Insurance Data Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores a health insurance dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/healthcare-insurance/data). My motivation stems from the growing importance of data in various fields, especially insurance, where data-driven decisions can have a significant impact. After working on a project for the Rio de Janeiro Health Bureau, my fascination with the healthcare sector deepened, inspiring me to analyze this dataset.

The goal of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights in the data. The initial visualizations and analyses were created in Python, and I also implemented the most interesting graphs in Tableau to further develop my data visualization skills.

## 📂 Dataset Source

- [Kaggle: Healthcare Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/healthcare-insurance/data)

## 🔍 What You Can Learn from the EDA

Through this analysis, you can discover:
- 🚬 How smoker status dramatically affects insurance charges.
- ⚖️ The relationship between BMI, age, and insurance costs.
- 🌎 Regional differences in average charges.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 The impact of family size, gender, and number of children on insurance costs.
- 📈 Distribution and outlier detection for key variables.
- 🔗 Correlations between different features.

These insights can help inform policy decisions, pricing strategies, and risk assessments in the insurance industry.
